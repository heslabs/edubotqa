### Q: What is key feature of AMBA CHI bus protocol?
* File: AMBA® AXI and ACE Protocol Specification AMBA® 5 CHI Architecture Specification
* AI:  ```A key feature of the AMBA CHI bus protocol is that it supports cache stashing requests, allowing I/O coherent AXI Managers to request data be stashed in fully coherent Managers. However, caches or system components can choose to ignore the stash part of a request – it’s a hint, not a requirement.```

### Q: What is the difference between Cortex-A55 and Cortex-A53?
 
The Cortex-A55 and Cortex-A53 processors are both part of Arm's Cortex-A series, but they have several key differences:

Architecture and Performance:

Cortex-A55: Implements the Armv8.2 architecture and builds on the success of the Cortex-A53, achieving higher performance while maintaining the same levels of power consumption 1 . It includes advanced features such as dedicated machine learning instructions and cryptography extensions 1 .
Cortex-A53: Implements the Armv8-A architecture and is known for its power efficiency and performance in a wide range of applications 2 .

Cache and Memory:

Cortex-A55: Features an L2 cache that runs at the same frequency as the CPU, which, combined with lower latency, offers a significant increase in performance 1 . It also includes a new L3 cache shared across all the Cortex-A55 CPUs within the cluster 1 .
Cortex-A53: Has a 2-level cache hierarchy with each core having its own L1 cache and a shared L2 cache 2 .

DynamIQ Technology:

Cortex-A55: Part of the first generation of application CPUs based on DynamIQ technology, which allows for a single cluster design with a mix of up to eight big.LITTLE processors 1 .
Cortex-A53: Does not utilize DynamIQ technology but can be used in big.LITTLE configurations with other processors 2 .

NEON and SIMD Extensions:

Cortex-A55: Features an improved NEON pipeline and the addition of 8-bit integer architectural instructions, which significantly enhance its machine learning performance, particularly in matrix multiplication operations 1 .
Cortex-A53: Also includes the NEON SIMD architecture extension, but without the specific enhancements found in the Cortex-A55 

Target Applications:

Cortex-A55: Targeted at applications such as mobile augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) and automotive systems, where high performance and power efficiency are crucial 1 .
Cortex-A53: Used in a variety of applications, including the Raspberry Pi 3, where it provides a balance of performance and power efficiency 
In summary, the Cortex-A55 offers several advancements over the Cortex-A53, including improved performance, enhanced machine learning capabilities, and the integration of DynamIQ technology, while maintaining similar power efficiency.
