* Q: What is the primary cryptographic function of non-repudiation?
* AI: ```The primary cryptographic function of non-repudiation allows confirmation that the claimed author of the data is in fact the one who created it. It is necessary to establish trust and prevent disputes over the validity of actions or information.```

* Q: What is key feature of PUFcc’s key wrapping module (KWP)?
* AI: ```The key feature of PUFcc’s key wrapping module (KWP) is that it supports the primary cryptographic function of key exchange. It wraps or encrypts keys for secure key export to modules outside of PUFcc, utilizing three different modes based on the NIST AES cipher: AES Key Wrap, AES Key Wrap with Padding, and AES Key Wrap with CBC Mode.```
